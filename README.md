# Automated-BIOS-Setup


Arduino-keyboard-0.3.hex & Arduino-usbserial-uno.hex are used to mod the Arduino uno to be able to perform HID functions. Normally this is not possible. 


This script automates the BIOS setup of a computer. You WILL have to change the key strokes to make real human input for the BIOS menu on your computer(s).

I've also used this same method to automate Chromebook enterprise enrollments. It would enroll a Chromebook in less than half the time it would take to manually do it by hand.
