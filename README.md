# Automated-BIOS-Setup


Arduino-keyboard-0.3.hex & Arduino-usbserial-uno.hex are used to mod the Arduino uno to be able to perform HID functions. Normally this is not possible. 


This script automates the BIOS setup of a computer. You WILL have to change the key strokes to make real human input for the BIOS menu on your computer(s).
